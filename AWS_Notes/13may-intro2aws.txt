Cloud 
- virtual kitchen 

************
Service models 
1. SaaS - package - CRMS, HRMS, 0365, Gsuite... { google apps for work] 
2. PaaS - focus on apps than on opers
3. IaaS - Compute, network, db, storage... price - 0.5$/GB, VM cost  0.016 /hr 


FaaS - Function as a service - serverless  - Lambda.. 
cloud native applns - microservices, containers,devops, CICD...[ 4 pillars]  

notification - sms, email.. sns, sqs.. 

SERVERLESS - pricing - reqeusts /second/min/hr

***********
Deployment models 
public,  - pre defined outburst - public car(ola, uber) 
private -  security , ownership  - own car 
hybrid - security + scale- combo- zoom car 
community - reuse, templates, federated ...  - accessories - plug and play model

Storage v/s db 

storage 					        DB 
need not be organized 				to be organized 
no need of a schema 				to be schematic 
querying is not a language 			can be queried with SQL /otehr equvl way 	
any data							important data

STorage -

cold  - data infrequtly accessed, offline , slow 

CCTV camera footages- 1 week in hot stroage-> move it to cold

storage classes 
standard  - default - 30 days  
S3-IA 
S3  one zone 
s3 - glacier - cold


bucket - space to hold objects 

CRoss region replication - explictly 

****3 types of resources 
1. fully manged - s3, dynamoDB
2. managed - rds 
3. unmanaged  - ec2(vms)  - placement groups 


DB - PaaS 
Transactional  - OLTP
RDS  - relational - oracle, MS SQL , mysql, postgres, mariadb, aurora
DynamoDB  - NoSQL  
DocumentDB - NoSQL - mongodb compatible 
Neptune - NoSQL - Graph DB

Performance
ElastiCache - improve performance 

Analytical  - Data warehousing- OLAP 
Redshift - infomatica, terradata. 

***LICENSING MODEL 

GNU license  - Open source - mysql, postgres, mariadb - GPL - general public license 
BYOL  -Bring your own license- proprietary softwares - Oracle, MSSQL - aws service usage
licenses inluded - software licens + aws service usage

***REPLICATION MODEL 
fail over replica - DR - main zone (a) , copy zone (b) 

read replica - same or different - multiple reads 


**MONITORING 
- basic  - by default - free of cost 
- enhanced  - by choice - with extra cost

** Maintainence 
- major version upgrade  mysql 5.6 -> mysql 6.1 
- minor version upgrade  mysql 5.6 -> mysql 5.7

** 3 types of users on AWS 
1. Root - all permission - CC details 
2. IAM user  - no priv by default , need to grant explictly 
3. Federated user - restricted access - SSO
Qwiklabs - AWS

working for client - client ID card/emailID - Public IP 

IPv4 Public IP
52.12.222.196   |  NEW IP :34.213.145.221
Private IPs
172.31.61.227  | NEW IP : 172.31.61.227


www.subhamita.com -> 34.212.99.138 [ irrespective of restarts]

ElasticIP - reserving an IP for my site

After EIP: 34.212.99.138

** STEPS to connect to VM from backend using SSH - Putty interface
1. Use Putty gen software to convert .pem -> .ppk file 
2. Load - locate the .pem file -> save Private key as .ppk file 
3. Use this key as authenticatino in your Putty interface 

FOR OPEN NETWORK within Infy 
RAISE AN AHD : https://cloudconnect/ [ Open in IE ] 

login as: ec2-user

containers - bundling both app + dependent libraries -> portability
ECS, EKS- kubernetes (k8s- open source orchestratino system) 

Elastic Beanstalk
Environment - s3, EIP, security group, VM 


Networking 
1. VPC - for own security
2. Direct connect  - bridge b/w your dc + amazon dc. 
3. Cloud front 
4. Route 53 - DNS resolver 
https://aws.amazon.com/route53/what-is-dns/ (22 min) 
first 5 mins - detailed overview of dns - call helpdesk
record sets : 
A 
NS  - Name server
SOA  - Start of authority

VPC : your own namespace - 
- at the time of login - you'll have a default VPC  - CAMPUS 
Employee - got an offer letter and he join the company 
employee 	                                              AWS
ID card      											 account 
campus 													default VPC 
building 												your own VPC 
 -public - pantry, cafetarias.. 			  -public subnet- webserver, appserver 		
 -private - ODCs, DC, 						-private subnet - DBs[ no direct internet]
 

communication - voip, ping, mail, yammer ... 
private communication - mail, call them mobile...

Route table - updated 
route table 
IG - access to public 

Cloud front - CDN - caching principle 



Routing policies 
1. linear round robin 
2. Latency based  - fastest path
3. Geo based - shortest path
4. weighted round robin - 50,30,20.. 
5. multivalue.. 



****Management tools :
1. Cloud Watch  - monitoring of resoruces under AWS - alarms [ lambda lab] 
2. Cloud trail  - monitor activities on AWS [console/cli/api] - audit
